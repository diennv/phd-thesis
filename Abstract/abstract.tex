\begin{abstract}
Video Analytics(VA) systems have an important role in many security areas such as public security, transportation and other industry fields. An important feature of these systems is that it is difficult and critical to analyze at real-time speed to generate timely event alerts on different scenario application. Because of the bandwidth and computation limitation, VA servers can not meet the real-time requirements when serving for many cameras simultaneously. In order to overcome these challenges, this dissertation propose a method to minimizes transfer of video data from the surveillance camera sources to a video analytics server on the cloud by using the edge-computing based system. The proposed method was conducted and published in our lab publication \cite{nguyen2020toward}. By utilizing the information from the encoded bitstream, the edge device can obtain low-complexity of the moving object tracking and filters non-motion frames from the list of frames which will be forwarded to the cloud server. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we deployed a video surveillance system which consist of an edge device with low computational capacity and a hight computing GPU-enabled server. The performance evaluation results show that our method is compatible with the edge-to-cloud platform and  can efficiently catch the motion of frame. The average inference time of this method is around 39 ms/frame with high definition(HD) resolution video, which is the state of art method. The experiment results show that the method helps the cloud server reduce 48\% utilization of GPU, 48\% load of CPU, and 51\% of download network traffic while still maintaining the accuracy of real-time video analytics event alerts.
